                <h1>The Statute of Westminster Appreciation Society of Canada</h1>
            </div>
        <p>For too long in Canada, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/enacted">the Statute of Westminster</a> has gone under-appreciated. Sure, thereâ€™s an entry for it in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/calendar/iclead4e0ec3/mac">Apple's Canadian holiday calendar</a> for its anniversary (December 11th, by the way), and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/important-commemorative-days/anniversary-statute-westminster.html">the Government of Canada even has a page about it</a>. Not about the Act, but the anniversary thereof.</p>
        <p>Is it a holiday? No, it is not. The Statute of Westminster Appreciation Society (SOWAS) of Canada aims to rectify that.</p>

        <p>On every December 11th, members of the society will read the Act and reflect on what it means to them, personally, as well as what it means to Canada, the Commonwealth, and really, the entire world.</p>
        <h2>Who's Behind This?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://richard.eriksson.ca/">Richard Eriksson</a>. Is the Society real? No, it is not. But when it does become real, he calls President.</a></p>
        <h2>Are there other Statute of Westminster Appreciation Societies?</h2>
        <p>Not that we know of, but the Act applied to Australia, the Irish Free State (which was a thing back in the 1920s and 30s), Newfoundland (famously entering Canadian Confederation in 1949), New Zealand and South Africa. So they could have their own.</p>
